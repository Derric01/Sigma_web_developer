# ✅ React State Management & Advanced Concepts

This project is a complete walkthrough of **React's intermediate and advanced topics**, each modularized in its own file and connected through `App.jsx`.

---

## 📦 Topics Covered

### 🧩 Intermediate React Topics
- `useEffect` – Side effects and lifecycle simulation
- Lifting State – Sharing data between components via a common parent
- `useReducer` – Alternative to `useState` for complex logic

### 🌐 Advanced State Management
- Context API – Avoid prop drilling and manage global state
- `useReducer` + Context – Scalable and predictable state management pattern

### 🪝 Advanced Hooks & Optimization
- Custom Hooks – Reusable logic with `useLocalStorage`
- `useMemo` – Expensive computation memoization
- `useCallback` – (Optional) Prevent unnecessary re-renders of functions
