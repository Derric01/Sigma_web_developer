# 🔁 React Counter App – Updater Function Edition

A simple but powerful React counter app built to **demonstrate the updater function** in `useState`. Perfect for beginners who want to deeply understand how state works in React!

---

## 🧠 What is the Updater Function?

When you want to update state based on its **previous value**, you should **not** use:
```js
setCount(count + 1); ❌
```

Instead, use the **updater function form**:
```js
setCount((prev) => prev + 1); ✅
```

This ensures you're always working with the **latest state**, especially when calling `setCount` multiple times in a row.

### ⚠️ Why this matters?

```js
// This WON'T increase by 3, it may only increase by 1!
setCount(count + 1);
setCount(count + 1);
setCount(count + 1);
```

But using the updater function:

```js
// This will reliably increase by 3!
setCount((c) => c + 1);
setCount((c) => c + 1);
setCount((c) => c + 1);
```

✅ This is because React may batch state updates, and `count + 1` might reuse the same stale value.
