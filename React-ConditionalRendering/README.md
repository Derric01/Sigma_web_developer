# 🔄 React Conditional Rendering — Concept Demo

This is a simple concept demo showing how **conditional rendering** works in React using **props** and a touch of **styling**.

## 🧠 What’s Conditional Rendering?

Conditional rendering lets you display different content based on a condition — like whether a user is logged in or not. It works just like JavaScript conditions but inside JSX.

## 💡 What You’ll Learn

- How to pass props (`isLoggedIn`, `username`)
- How to render different UI using:
  - `if...else` statements
  - the **ternary operator**
- How to apply conditional **CSS styling** with class names

## 📂 Where to Look

Check these files to see it in action:

- `App.jsx` → Passes props to the component
- `UserGreeting.jsx` → Handles the conditional rendering logic
- `style.css` (or your CSS file) → Applies different styles for each condition

## ✨ Output Preview

- ✅ If the user is logged in:  
  `Welcome Derric` with a green, styled background

- ❌ If not:  
  `Please Log in` with a red background

---

Try changing the `isLoggedIn` prop in `App.jsx` to `false` and see what happens! 🧪

Happy learning! 🚀
